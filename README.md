# Creating-a-WPF-Stacked-Area-100-Chart-to-Visualize-the-World-Vehicle-Production-in-Major-Countries


A stacked area 100 series is a type of data visualization that represents multiple data series stacked on top of each other, with each series normalized to 100%. In this visualization, the total height of each point along the x-axis represents 100%, and the different colored areas represent the proportion of each data series contributing to that total at any given point.

Here, we have showing the relative contribution of different categories of vehicle production to a whole over time. It allows for easy comparison of the distribution of vehicle production among categories while maintaining a consistent scale across all points on the x-axis.

## Customizing the axis 
This involves fine-tuning various aspects of how the axes are presented in a visual representation, such as a chart or graph. The following properties allow for tailored adjustments to both primary and secondary axes:

### FontSize: 
This property enables adjustments to the font size of the axis labels. By modifying the font size, users can ensure that the labels are legible and appropriately sized for the visualization.

### ShowGridLines: 
Gridlines provide a visual aid that helps users interpret the data points on the chart. This property allows users to control the visibility of these gridlines, toggling them on or off as needed for clarity.

### LabelPlacement: 
Proper positioning of axis labels is crucial for readability. The LabelPlacement property allows users to specify where the labels appear relative to the axis, ensuring they do not overlap or obstruct other elements of the chart.

### Visibility:
This property governs the visibility of the axis line itself. Users can choose to display or hide the axis line based on their preferences or the specific requirements of the visualization.
